         <h1>Fang (Town)</h1>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the Yonok chronicle, <em>Mueang Fang</em> was built in 641 by King Lawa Changkarat. Later <b>King Mengrai the Great</b> reigned in Fang before building Wiang Kum Kam and Chiang Mai of the Lanna Kingdom for one year around 1268. It seems that Mengrai used Mueang Fang for the base to invade Hariphunchai.

<h2>Etymology</h2>
